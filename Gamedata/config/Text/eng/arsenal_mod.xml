Design work on the AK began in 1944, and it was officially adopted by the Soviet Armed Forces in 1949. It has also been used by the majority of the member states of the former Warsaw Pact. The AK-47 was also used as a basis for the development of countless many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. It was one of the first true assault rifles and, due to its low price, durability and ease of use, remains the most widely used assault rifle in the world.

	%c[255,255,255,255]An AN-94 assault rifle.\n\nThe AN-94 (sometimes called the "Abakan") is a modern Russian assault rifle. The acronym stands for Avtomat Nikonova (after Gennadiy Nikonov) Model 1994, and it was chosen over many other competing firearms in an extensive trial. The AN-94 was designed as a replacement for the AK-74M assault rifle, but the Russian military has chosen to retain the AK-74M as its standard service rifle and the AN-94 is only being issued to the elite forces of the Russian military, some Russian police forces, and the MVD. The AN-94 is chambered in the same 5.45x39mm M74 cartridge as the AK-74. The AN-94's unique mechanism allows a much higher rate of fire than would otherwise be possible. This high rate of fire (1800 rounds/min) is employed in two-round bursts. These form the first two shots on fully automatic fire, with following rounds fired at 600 rounds/min. This is highly effective against body armour; the second round impacts at the same point as the first, enabling the penetration of armour that a conventional 5.45mm system cannot. The rear peep sight is a dramatic improvement over the standard Kalashnikov notch and post. The muzzle brake is much more effective and produces a quieter weapon report than the AK-74.\n

It was highly advanced for the 1970s, combining in the same weapon the bullpup configuration, a polymer housing, dual vertical grips, an optical sight as standard, and a modular design. A highly reliable, light, and accurate rifle, the Steyr AUG showed clearly the potential of the bullpup layout.\n

The FAMAS assault rifle is a bullpup configuration, with the ammunition feed behind the trigger. The FAMAS first saw service in Chad during Operation Manta and again in desert operations in Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm and in other various peacekeeping missions. Operational conditions proved the weapon to be reliable and trustworthy under combat conditions. The FAMAS was affectionately known by French troops as clairon ("bugle", because of its shape). Though newer versions of this weapon have been developed and deployed, the F1 remains the main service rifle of the French military.\n

The FNC is produced in two primary configurations: a standard rifle and short (carbine) length. Currently the FNC has been adopted by the armed forces of Belgium, Nigeria, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Sweden. The Swedish service rifle built by Bofors Ordnance (currently BAE Systems Bofors) is a modernized carbine that lacks the burst fire control setting. Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to adopt the complete system, converting from the 7.62mm FN FAL to the 5.56mm FN FNC and the Minimi Squad support weapon, as far back as 1981.\n

It is available as a complete firearm, or as an upper receiver kit that fits on any AR-15 type lower receiver. The US Army’s Delta Force collaborated with the German arms makers to develop the new carbine. It replaced its M4s with the HK416 in 2004 after tests revealed that the piston operating system significantly reduces malfunctions while increasing the life of parts. The project was originally called the HKM4, but this was changed in response to a trademark infringement suit filed by Colt Defense. It is speculated that "416" is a reference to the M4 and M16 it's designed to succeed. So far the weapon has reportedly been tested by the United States military as well as some law enforcement agencies. It is only available to government and military organizations currently.\n

	%c[255,255,255,255]An LR 300 ML assault rifle.\n\nThe LR 300 ML is an assault rifle designed and manufactured by Z-M Weapons. One stated feature of the rifle is its "diverted felt recoil" which helps prevent muzzle rise common to most other select-fire rifles and carbines. Also notable is the rifle's capability to use a fully folding skeletal stock. Most AR-15/M16 rifle variants have a thick, cylindrical recoil buffer tube that protrudes several inches straight back from the rear of the receiver, and the weapon cannot operate without it. This normally precludes the use of anything but fixed or telescoping stocks. The LR-300 ML has a flat top receiver, allowing it to be used with multiple types of sights and accessories. The trigger, as well as the charging handle, magazine button, and hold open device etc., are the same as the M16 and AR-15 rifles. The grip angle of the rifle is the same as that of John Browning's M1911 pistol; as Browning's choice of grip angle on the 1911 pistol is frequently called "perfect" and held by some to be the "gold standard" for pistol grip angles, the reproduction of that firearm's grip angle in the pistol grip of the LR 300 is said to further aid in making it a far more controllable rifle than others.\n

It is a shorter and lighter version of the M16A2 assault rifle, achieving 80% parts commonality with the M16A2. The M4 has selective fire options including semi-automatic and three-round burst (like the M16A2), while the M4A1 has a "full auto" option in place of the three-round burst. The M4 and variants fire 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition and are gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed firearms with a 4-position telescoping stock. Original M4 models had a flat-ended telescoping stock, but newer models are now equipped with a redesigned telescoping stock that is slightly larger with curvature at the end. As with many carbines, the M4 is handy and more convenient to carry than a full-length rifle. While this makes it a candidate for non-infantry troops (vehicle crews, clerks and staff officers), it also makes it ideal for close quarters combat (CQC), and airborne and special operations. It has been adopted by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and is the preferred weapon of the U.S. Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs. The M4 is similar to much earlier compact M16 versions, such as the 1960s-era XM177 family.\n

The vz. 58 bears a superficial resemblance to the Soviet AK-47 but the two weapons are not related. Over the period of 25 years (up until 1984) over 920,000 had been produced, used by the armed forces of the Czech and Slovak Republics, Cuba and several other Asian and African nations.\n

The Stechkin pistol was originally chambered for 7.62x25mm Tokarev. Stechkin changed the pistol to the 9mm caliber used in the new Makarov pistol (PM), as it became clear that this cartridge was set to become the new service ammunition for handguns of the Red Army. In 1951, both the Makarov and Stechkin were introduced into the Soviet military arsenal, replacing the trusted Tokarev TT-33. Not only do they look similar but they do indeed have much in common, such as the simple unlocked blow-back mechanism and the double-action trigger. In contrast to the Makarov, the Stechkin APS has an automatic fire mode, which is selected using the safety lever. In burst or automatic fire, the pistol should be fitted with the wooden shoulder stock; otherwise, the weapon is difficult to control. The detachable stock is similar in appearance and design to that of the Mauser C96, and likewise, the pistol can be stored inside when not in use. The extra weight of the stock helps to control the recoil.\n

Around 200,000 vz. 52s ("vzor 52" means "model of 1952") were made by Ceská Zbrojovka in Strakonice from 1952 to 1954. It replaced the 7.65mm Browning caliber (.32 ACP) Vz.50, which had acquired a reputation for unreliability and also was underpowered for its role as a military service sidearm. The vz. 52 was, after 30 years of military service, eventually replaced in service by the vz. 82. The vz. 52 is well known for its very sharp report and the great amount of muzzle flash it produces. Nevertheless, it is regarded by many as a reliable and remarkably powerful weapon as its penetration is effective against body armour.\n

	%c[255,255,255,255]A Desert Eagle Mark XIX .50AE pistol.\n\nThe Desert Eagle is a large caliber semi-automatic pistol designed by Magnum Research in the U.S., and manufactured primarily in Israel by IMI (Israel Military Industries, now Israel Weapon Industries). The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated mechanism normally found in rifles, as opposed to the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. The advantage of the gas-operation is that it allows the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs, and it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by magnum revolvers. Downsides of the gas operated mechanism are the large size and weight of the Desert Eagle, and the fact that it discourages the use of unjacketed lead bullets, as lead particles sheared off during firing could clog the gas release tap, preventing proper function. Despite being featured in many video games and action films as the ultimate pistol, in reality the Desert Eagle's combination of heavy recoil, weight, relatively low magazine capacity and high price make it a poor choice for military use. This weapon is chambered in .50 Action Express, with a 7 round magazine capacity.\n

The Fort-12 pistol is an attempt of the independent Ukraine (one of the former USSR republics) to develop its own police pistol to replace Soviet era, aging Makarov PM pistols. To accomplish this task, Ukrainian state-owned FORT factory purchased Czech machinery from Ceská Zbrojovka Uherský Brod factory, and by the late 1990s developed its first pistol, the Fort-12. Currently, this gun is issued to the Ukrainian police and security forces and also sold on civilian market chambered for non-lethal rubber ammunition or tear gas ammunition. Early production Fort-12 pistols were reported as only marginally reliable, but at the present time most of the teething problems are gone, and Fort-12 pistol provides some improvements over the older Makarov PM in the ergonomics, accuracy and magazine capacity. The Fort-12's magazine is of double column type, and holds 12 rounds of ammunition, magazine release button is located at the base of the trigger guard, on the left side of the frame.\n

It was widely used in World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Its formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 for the original Model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924. The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam era. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols during its service life.\n\nThe M1911 is the most well-known of John Browning's designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design. Besides the pistol being widely copied itself, this operating system rose to become the pre-eminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols.\n

	%c[255,255,255,255]A Browning Hi-Power MK. III 9x19mm pistol.\n\nThe Browning Hi-Power is a single-action, 9mm semi-automatic pistol. It is based on ideas conceived and patented in 1922 by American firearms inventor John Browning, and later patented by Fabrique Nationale (FN) of Herstal, Belgium. Browning died in 1926, before he had finished developing a production version. The design was fully developed and realized by Belgian arms designer Dieudonne Saive, working at FN. The Hi-Power pistol was named for its 13-round magazine capacity, which was almost twice that of contemporary designs such as the Luger or Mauser 1910. The Hi-Power had the first functional double-column magazine of 9mm rounds, and was capable of holding 13 cartridges, with a 14th loaded in the chamber. Flush-fit 15 round magazines are now available, as well as higher capacity magazines which extend past the end of the butt. The pistol is often referred to as an HP (for "Hi-Power") or P-35 (for its year of introduction). Another nickname is the "King of Nines." It is most often called the "Hi-Power".\n

It was intended to replace the costly Luger P08, the production of which was scheduled to end in 1942. Production of the P38 continued until the end of the war and into the post war period. The early Walthers, until late 1941, were made to almost commercial standards of fit and polish. As the pressures of war required increased production the exterior finish declined but the operating components of the P38 remained remarkably well-made throughout the war, especially at Mauser. Total German production is estimated at more than 1,200,000 pistols. Production of the P38 resumed at a new Walther factory in Ulm, West Germany under the name Pistole 1 (P1) in 1958 for West German Police and the Bundeswehr. It remained in Walther production, in several revised iterations, until the early 1990s.\n

The P220 was initially imported to the United States as the Browning Double Action (BDA) and then as the P220. It was offered for sale in 9mm, .38 Super (a rare model), and .45 ACP. However, all modern P220 variants are only available in .45 ACP. The SIG P220 was developed for the Swiss Army as a replacement for the SIG P210, which had been developed during World War II; in service it is known as "Pistole 75" (P75). For development of the P220, SIG collaborated with J.P. Sauer and Sohn of Germany, thus, the P220 and all subsequent pistols from SIG are properly known as SIG-Sauer pistols. The P220 operates by the locked breech short-recoil method pioneered by John Browning. In 1975, Switzerland became the first nation to officially adopt the P220 as the "Pistole 75" (P75) chambered in 9mm Parabellum. Other nations to adopt it for military use include Japan and Denmark. It was succeeded by the SIG Sauer P226.\n

	%c[255,255,255,255]A PB/6P9 semi-automatic pistol.\n\nThe PB (Pistolet Besshumnyj - Silenced Pistol), also known for Soviet/Russian army as 6P9, has been developed by 1967 for Spetsnaz elements of the Soviet army, as well as for operatives of KGB. The pistol is based on the Makarov PM pistol, and features a unique integral two-part silencer. The rear part of the silencer is fixed around the barrel, which is drilled to decrease the muzzle velocity below the speed of sound. The front part of the silencer is quickly detachable, so pistol can be broken down into two parts for more convenient carry. Unlike many other integrally silenced pistols the PB can be safely fired with the front part of the silencer removed, but this will greatly increase the sound signature. Still, it is an useful emergency feature. Because the front part of the barrel is enclosed into the silencer, the slide is made very short and cannot contain the return spring. Instead, the return spring is located in the grip, under the right panel, and linked to the slide via the rocking lever. The double-action firing unit with external hammer and slide-mounted safety/decocker, as well as the magazine, are borrowed from Makarov PM pistol with no modification. PB has fixed sights. For carry, it is issued with a special holster, which has compartments for the gun and the detached front part of the silencer.\n

For simplicity and economy, the Makarov pistol is of straight blowback operation, with the 9x18mm cartridge being the most powerful cartridge that its design could safely fire. It remained in service with Soviet military and police until the end of the U.S.S.R. in 1991. Today, the Makarov is a popular handgun for concealed carry in the U.S.; and variants of the Makarov remain in production in Russia and Bulgaria. The most common pistol in the Zone, by far.\n

It saw use with the NKVD secret police as well as border guards. In 1938 and 1940, modifications were designated PPD-34/38 and PPD-40 respectively, and introduced minor changes. Nevertheless, the PPD-40 was too complicated and expensive to mass-produce, and although it was used in action in the initial stages of World War II, it was, by the end of 1941, quickly phased out and replaced by the superior and cheaper PPSh-41.\n

The PPSh has a simple blow-back action, and fires the 7.62x25mm pistol round from a box or drum magazine. The impetus for the development of the PPSh came partly from the Winter War against Finland, where it was found that submachine guns were a highly effective tool for close-quarter fighting in forests or built-up urban areas. Over 6 million of these weapons were produced by the end of the war. The Soviets would often equip whole regiments and even entire divisions with the weapon, giving them unmatched short-range firepower.\n

The early prototype HK417 utilized 20-round magazines from the G3 rifle family, which did not feature a bolt hold-open device. Later prototypes, however, switched to a polymer magazine with bolt hold-open. The magazine is similar to the G36 series transparent magazine, except without the pins for holding more than one magazine together.

The precision rifle is a strictly semi-automatic rifle operated by a gas-piston system with a rotating bolt, and fed from a 25-round box magazine. The rifle uses a heavy profile match barrel that is heavier than that used in the ARM. It is fitted with a multi-functional muzzle device, which also acts as a flash suppressor. It can be replaced with a sound suppressor which requires the use of subsonic ammunition for maximum effectiveness. The weapon was modified with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden buttstock that folds to the right side of the weapon and a heavy-duty bipod, mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the hand-guard when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical iron sights and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6x40) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after remounting. The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that also comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing) and a cleaning kit.

Extensive testing of the rifles in variable environmental conditions resulted in E. F. Dragunov’s design being accepted into service in 1963. At the same time an initial pre-production batch of 200 rifles was assembled, and from 1964 serial production was carried out at Izhmash. Since then, the SVD has become the standard squad support weapon of several countries, including those of the former Warsaw Pact, among them Poland (since 1966).

	%c[255,255,255,255]An l86A1 assault rifle.\n\nThe L85 is a British 5.56mm bullpup assault rifle, part of the SA80 (Small Arms for the 1980s) family of firearms. The remainder of the family comprises the L86 Light Support Weapon, the short-barreled L22 carbine and the L98 Cadet rifle.The L86A1 LSW is magazine-fed automatic weapon originally intended to provide fire support at a fireteam level. It has a longer barrel than the L85A1 and a bipod, shoulder trap and rear pistol grip, together with a different type of handguard. The extended barrel provides an increased muzzle velocity and further stabilises the bullet, giving a greater effective range. The weapon is otherwise identical to the L85 version it is based on and the magazines and some internal parts are interchangeable.The L86A1 was upgraded to the L86A2 at the same time as L85A1 rifles were upgraded to L85A2 standards, undergoing the same set of modifications.\n

	%c[255,255,255,255]An MP5A3 submachine gun.\n\nThe Heckler and Koch MP5 is a 9mm submachine gun of German design, developed in the 1960s by a team of engineers from the West German small arms manufacturer Heckler and Koch. Heckler and Koch, encouraged by the success of the G3 automatic rifle, developed a family of small arms consisting of four types of firearms (all based on a common G3 design layout and operating principle), where the first type was chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, the second—using the 7.62x39mm M43 round, third—the intermediate 5.56x45mm NATO caliber and the fourth type—chambering the 9x19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. The MP5 was created within the fourth group of firearms and was initially known as the HK54. The design eventually evolved into the MP5A2, which is now the primary version of the weapon.\n\nReknowned for its accuracy, handling and reliability, the MP5 is currently used by the armed forces and law enforcement units of over 40 countries. It remains one of the most widely deployed of all current submachine guns and has been developed into a family with numerous variants. This particular variant is the MP5A3, with a retractable buttstock and "SEF" trigger group.\n

		<text>A box of .50 AE (12.7x33mm) pistol cartridges. These cartridges are full metal jacket, and provide good stopping power against soft targets with good armor-piercing capability.\n\nThe .50 Action Express (AE, 12.7x33mm) is a large caliber handgun cartridge. It was developed in 1988 by Evan Whildin of Action Arms. The Magnum Research Desert Eagle was the first handgun chambered for the .50 AE. Among the few commercial handgun cartridges designed that exceed its ballistic performance are the .454 Casull, .460 SW Magnum and the .500 SW Magnum. The actual cartridge has a .547 inch (13.9mm) diameter base, with a rebated rim that is the same diameter as the .44 Magnum. The case length, at 1.285", is also identical to that of the .44 Magnum. This allows existing .44 Magnum Desert Eagle pistols to be upgraded to the new cartridge with only a barrel change. Original blueprints had been to use .510" diameter bullets (like the .50 BMG), but the polygonal rifling of the final prototype Desert Eagle allowed the .50 caliber bore plug to drop through, thus rendering the gun a destructive device under BATFE regulations. Nominal bullet diameter was reduced to the current 0.500 inch (12.7mm); The principal uses of the .50 AE are metallic silhouette shooting and hunting. Recoil of the .50 AE in the Desert Eagle pistol is substantial, although only marginally more severe than the .44 Magnum, as the auto mechanism smooths the recoil somewhat. The cartridge is quite loud as well, and a distinct flash is apparent, even in daylight. For these reasons, the .50 AE is not a cartridge for the beginner or novice. It is also quite expensive, at over $40 per box of 20 rounds.</text>
