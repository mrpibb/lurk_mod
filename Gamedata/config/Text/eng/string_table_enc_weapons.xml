The SG 552 "Commando" features a very small frame compared to the original SG 550, with a redesigned flash hider, bolt carrier and several other components.</text>

	%c[default]The OTs-14 Groza is a bullpup Russian specialized assault rifle, developed in 1994 by TsKIB SOO for use by Russian special forces. It is based on the AK-74U carbine, sharing a high percentage of part commonality, and used primarily by MVD agents and certain Russian military divisions. The bullpup design is reputedly well balanced enough that users have found that firing the Groza in a single hand is easily possible, and the addition of an intergrated grenade launcher makes it a versatile weapon.</text>

	%c[default]The SR-25 (Stoner Rifle 25) is a marksman rifle developed by Knight's Armament Company in 1990, based on the AR-10 made by Eugene Stoner. Using a rotating bolt and direct-impingement system, it shares roughly a 60% part commonality with the AR-10. The SR-25 uses a Picatinny rail to mount optics on, and an adapter for use with sound suppressors.</text>

	%c[default]The Snayperskaya Vintovka Dragunova, or Dragunov Sniper Rifle, is a semi automatic sniper rifle, developed by the former USSR in 1958. It was chosen over two other designs for a service sniper rifle for the Soviet Union. Since then, it has become standard issue to many countries formerly belonging to the Warsaw Pact, including Poland. The Dragunov SVD's design is similar to that of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, or AK-47. It features an intergrated x4.0 PSO-1 scope as standard.</text>

	%c[default]The X-C15 Linear Accelerator is a prototype weapon which uses magnetic coils to propell a tiny projectile at relativistic velocities. The name "Gauss" refers to the creator of the theory of magnetic propelled projectiles, Carl Friedrich Gauss. The unique design makes it a devastating weapon, punching holes through armour and flesh, with deadly accuracy and minimal recoil. The power source for the magnetic coils comes from the projectiles themselves. However, since the weapon is mostly a proof-of-concept, it is unreliable and jams easily, and requires frequent maintenance.</text>

The design was heavily influenced by the development of the Milkor MGL, minus some differences making it suitable for the 40mm caseless grenades.</text>
