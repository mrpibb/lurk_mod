		<text>Well it'll play out as follows. Starting in approximately 24 hours, we'll be prepared to host a restructured Arena, now that we've acquired enough officials to moderate it. You being one of them, if you choose to that is.\n\n You'll arrange matches that you may or may not participate in yourself, place wagers, and watch as the chaos unfolds.\n\n However, we have to organize the matches, so they'll be held at a specific time, however you'll be notified via radio broadcast when these events are going to occur.</text>

		<text>If you're absolutely sure of your abilities, might I suggest a timed match?

Remember one iron rule, you CANNOT kill your opponent after the timer runs out. If you do, you'll be fined the same amount as the winnings.\n\n I think you'll agree, it's better to stay with your own ass intact and with no prize than having to pay what you were supposed to win. And I need as many living contestants for other matches, too, so you'll help me by following that rule.\n\n Well, what do you say? Should I turn on that stopwatch?   </text>

		<text>Battle with the Military</text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_military_info">
		<text>I'm honestly surprised that they've managed to secure Military Soldiers as contestants for The Arena, however I don't make a point of asking too many questions.\n\n There aren't many doubts as to the professionalism of these soldiers. They all have alot of experience behind their shoulders to my knowledge at least. Some of these guys have been around during Afghanistan, Georgia, and Chechnya, and they've even spent a few years in the Zone, so they're still sharp. They're armed with the best guns their Russian government can produce. </text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_killer">
		<text>Match with Mercenaries</text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_killer_info">
		<text>Mercenaries are a very organized paramilitary group made up of many different private contractors. They carry imported guns, so they're not short on cash. Rumor says that they work for foreign interests and governments, in addition to Russian, Ukrainian, and possibly even Georgian clients.\n\n I'd call them a side-effect of Ukraine's government trying so hard to join NATO. Many locals try to keep as far away from them as they can, but to the military, they are like a sharp bone in their throats. They give the mercs the highest priority if they spot them, which kind of makes me respect the soldiers. The firepower of the mercs is hard to ignore, which is why some groupings even have contacts among them. </text>

	<string id="aem_freedom">
		<text>Fight with Freedom.</text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_freedom_info">
		<text>Freedomers are the arch enemies of Duty. They have alot of former Dutyers among their ranks, ones that rejected the "we are the last hope of humanity" ideology of that faction. That's one of the reasons why relations between the two factions are very tense, to put it softly. Even though Duty considers Freedom to be nothing more than a gaggle of stoned anarchists, Freedom still put up a hard fight.\n\n Freedom is definately more organized than that, and their guns and armor aren't that bad, either. Duty had many of their best fighters cross over, so their experience in battle is something to be respected. At the moment, there's a cease-fire between the two factions, but it's pretty shaky.</text>

		<text>Fight with Duty.</text>
		</string>
	<string id="aem_dolg_info">
		<text>The Duty faction is our self-declared police force. It's thanks to them that we have fights to the death in our humble arena, in addition to them capturing mutants for me. Members of this faction regularly participate in arena matches to sharpen their skills and practice for future raids into the deepest reaches of the Zone. They are armed with the same gear as our government's Spetsnaz, with the best Warsaw Pact firearms available.</text>

		<text>The usual loners, ones that either stay away from or have yet to join any faction. You might see some familiar faces among them, even recognize the guy you shared a bottle with a few weeks ago. It's a good way to make some enemies or thin out your competition for artifacts. They're armed with a myriad of guns. Warsaw Pact guns, imported rifles, you name it, but I've yet to see them armed with anything that makes me jealous.</text>
